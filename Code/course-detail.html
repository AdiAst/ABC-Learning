        <h2>#History</h2>
        <article>
            James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java
            language project in June 1991.Java was originally designed for
            interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable
            television industry at the time. The language was initially called Oak
            after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project
            went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a
            type of coffee from Indonesia. Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style
            syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.
            <br /><br />
            Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in
            1996. It promised write once, run anywhere (WORA) functionality,
            providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and
            featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access
            restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run
            Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java
            1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply
            strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification. With the advent of
            Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 1999), new
            versions had multiple configurations built for different types of
            platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise
            applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured
            APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed
            J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as
            Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.
            <br /><br />
            In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body
            and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew
            from the process. Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through
            the Java Community Process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java
            implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary
            software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of
            licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.
            <br /><br />
            On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine
            (JVM) as free and open-source software (FOSS), under the terms of the
            GPL-2.0-only license. On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making
            all of its JVM's core code available under free software/open-source
            distribution terms, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did
            not hold the copyright.
            <br /><br />
            Sun's vice-president Rich Green said that Sun's ideal role with regard
            to Java was as an evangelist. Following Oracle Corporation's acquisition
            of Sun Microsystems in 2009 10, Oracle has described itself as the
            steward of Java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a
            community of participation and transparency. This did not prevent Oracle
            from filing a lawsuit against Google shortly after that for using Java
            inside the Android SDK (see the Android section).
            <br /><br />
            On April 2, 2010, James Gosling resigned from Oracle.
            <br /><br />
            In January 2016, Oracle announced that Java run-time environments based
            on JDK 9 will discontinue the browser plugin.
            <br /><br />
            Java software runs on everything from laptops to data centers, game
            consoles to scientific supercomputers.

    It is recommended, before you proceed with online installation you may want
    to disable your Internet firewall. In some cases the default firewall
    settings are set to reject all automatic or online installations such as the
    Java online installation. If the firewall is not configured appropriately it
    may stall the download/install operation of Java under certain conditions.
    Refer to your specific Internet firewall manual for instructions on how to
    disable your Internet Firewall.

        <article>
          The .NET Framework (pronounced as "dot net") is a proprietary software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It was the predominant implementation of the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) until being superseded by the cross-platform .NET project. It includes a large class library called Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (in contrast to a hardware environment) named the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. As such, computer code written using .NET Framework is called "managed code". FCL and CLR together constitute the .NET Framework.
<br><br>
FCL provides the user interface, data access, database connectivity, cryptography, web application development, numeric algorithms, and network communications. Programmers produce software by combining their source code with .NET Framework and other libraries. The framework is intended to be used by most new applications created for the Windows platform. Microsoft also produces an integrated development environment for .NET software called Visual Studio.
<br><br>
.NET Framework began as proprietary software, although the firm worked to standardize the software stack almost immediately, even before its first release. Despite the standardization efforts, developers, mainly those in the free and open-source software communities, expressed their unease with the selected terms and the prospects of any free and open-source implementation, especially regarding software patents. Since then, Microsoft has changed .NET development to more closely follow a contemporary model of a community-developed software project, including issuing an update to its patent promising to address the concerns.
<br><br>
In April 2019, Microsoft released .NET Framework 4.8, the last version of the framework as a proprietary offering. Only monthly security and reliability bug fixes to that version have been released since then. No further changes to that version are planned.
